 This project showcases a group of race cars each given random colours everytime you press the 's' key to restart the race. The race itself starts immedietly and then stops until you press 's' to restart. each car is given a different rate of speed randomly so that its not only the one car thats always winning which makes the race more unpredictable for the user therefore more intriguing. On top of the car is a numnber and evercar starts with 0 once you run the code and when the first car reaches the finish line the number will increase by one. Once the first race finish you would then press 's' to restart but unlike hwne you run the code at the start the number on the car tht won wont reset it will still be showing 1 which shows that it won a race.
